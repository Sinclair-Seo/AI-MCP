# AI-MCP
AI MCP 프로젝트를 위한 Repository (AI MCP project repository)

AI-MCP (AI Multi-Cloud Platform) provides a foundation for running and managing
artificial intelligence workloads across different environments. This
repository currently contains only the initial project files and will expand as
development continues.

## Purpose and Scope

The goal of AI-MCP is to offer a unified platform for deploying and monitoring
machine-learning applications. Future revisions of this repository will include
source code, configuration examples and utilities for working across multiple
cloud providers and on-premise hardware.

## Project Structure

- `src/` – Source code for the project. The `main.py` file contains a placeholder entry point that can be expanded.
- `tests/` – Automated tests for the project. A basic test is included to verify the placeholder functionality.
- `requirements.txt` – Placeholder for Python dependencies.
- `.gitignore` – Standard ignores for Python projects and development tools.

## Getting Started

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the main program:
   ```bash
   python -m src.main
   ```
3. Execute the test suite with `pytest`:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest  # if not installed
   pytest
   ```

Feel free to extend this structure as development progresses.
