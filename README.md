# AI-MCP
AI MCP 프로젝트를 위한 Repository (AI MCP project repository)

AI-MCP (AI Multi-Cloud Platform) provides a foundation for running and managing
artificial intelligence workloads across different environments. This
repository currently contains only the initial project files and will expand as
development continues.

## Purpose and Scope

The goal of AI-MCP is to offer a unified platform for deploying and monitoring
machine-learning applications. Future revisions of this repository will include
source code, configuration examples and utilities for working across multiple
cloud providers and on-premise hardware.

## Dependencies

The platform is expected to use the following core tools:

- **Python 3.10+** – primary development language.
- **Git** – version control.
- **Docker** (optional) – for reproducible environments.

Any additional Python packages will be listed in `requirements.txt` as the
project grows.

## Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<yourname>/AI-MCP.git
   cd AI-MCP
   ```

2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies (placeholder – this file will be added later)

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Building the Platform

Build steps will be added as the code base develops. A typical command might
look like:

```bash
make build
```

## Running the Platform

Once application code is available, you will be able to start the main service
using a command similar to:

```bash
python main.py
```

Or, if using Docker:

```bash
docker compose up
```

1. Fork this repository and create a new branch from `main`.
2. Keep your changes focused and document them clearly.
3. Ensure new code is covered by tests once a testing framework is in place.
4. Submit a pull request for review.
