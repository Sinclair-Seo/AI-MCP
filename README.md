# AI-MCP

This repository contains the initial scaffold for the AI MCP project.

## Project Structure

- `src/` – Source code for the project. The `main.py` file contains a placeholder entry point that can be expanded.
- `tests/` – Automated tests for the project. A basic test is included to verify the placeholder functionality.
- `requirements.txt` – Placeholder for Python dependencies.
- `.gitignore` – Standard ignores for Python projects and development tools.

## Getting Started

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the main program:
   ```bash
   python -m src.main
   ```
3. Execute the test suite with `pytest`:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest  # if not installed
   pytest
   ```

Feel free to extend this structure as development progresses.
